# Innosuisse Innovation Project Evaluation Criteria

## Overview

Applications are evaluated by two independent experts and decided by the Innosuisse Innovation Council. The evaluation focuses on innovation potential and value creation for Switzerland.

---

## 1. Level of Innovation (Innovationsgrad)

### What Evaluators Look For
- **Scientific novelty**: New methods, technologies, approaches
- **Economic novelty**: New products, services, business models
- **State-of-the-art advancement**: Clear differentiation from existing solutions
- **Risk-taking**: Willingness to pursue ambitious goals

### Scoring Dimensions
| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| High | Disruptive innovation; paradigm shift; high-risk high-reward |
| Medium | Significant advancement; clear differentiation from competitors |
| Low | Incremental improvement; limited novelty |

### How to Demonstrate
- Compare explicitly to state-of-the-art solutions
- Reference Technology Readiness Level (TRL) progression
- Show patent landscape analysis (freedom to operate)
- Cite scientific literature gaps being addressed
- Quantify improvement over existing solutions

### Red Flags
- "No one has done this before" without evidence
- Innovation claims without clear differentiation
- Purely incremental improvements marketed as breakthrough
- Copying existing solutions with minor modifications

## 2. Value Creation / Potential Benefit

### What Evaluators Look For
- **Economic benefit for implementation partner**: Revenue, cost savings, efficiency
- **Benefit for Swiss economy/society**: Jobs, competitiveness, exports
- **Market validation**: Evidence of demand
- **Commercialization pathway**: Clear route to market

### Scoring Dimensions
| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| High | Large validated market, customer commitments, clear commercialization path |
| Medium | Solid market potential, some validation, reasonable path to market |
| Low | Unclear market, no validation, vague commercialization strategy |

### How to Demonstrate
- Market size estimates (TAM/SAM/SOM) with sources
- Customer validation (LOIs, pilot customers, interviews)
- Revenue projections with clear assumptions
- Job creation estimates (direct and indirect)
- Export potential and international competitiveness
- Time-to-market estimate

### Required Evidence
- At least proof of potential demand
- Market analysis including competitor analysis
- Business model description
- Value chain positioning

### Red Flags
- "The market is huge" without data
- No customer validation or market research
- Benefits only for research partner, not implementation partner
- Vague commercialization timeline

## 3. Quality of Project Planning and Staff Expertise

### What Evaluators Look For
- **Realistic timeline**: Achievable with proposed resources
- **Clear milestones**: Measurable, time-bound success criteria
- **Team competence**: Right expertise for the project
- **Risk awareness**: Identified risks with concrete mitigations
- **Resource adequacy**: Sufficient budget and personnel

### Scoring Dimensions
| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| High | Detailed WPs, measurable milestones, experienced team, thorough risk analysis |
| Medium | Reasonable planning, some gaps, adequate team |
| Low | Vague planning, unrealistic timeline, team expertise gaps |

### How to Demonstrate
- Detailed work packages with dependencies
- Gantt chart with milestones spread across project duration
- Team CVs showing relevant experience
- Risk matrix with probability x impact assessment
- Go/no-go decision points
- Clear deliverable definitions with acceptance criteria

### Red Flags
- Vague deliverables (e.g., "a report", "prototype")
- No risk analysis or only generic risks
- Mismatched team expertise for proposed work
- Unrealistic timeline (too short or too long)
- Milestones concentrated at project end
- Missing go/no-go decision points

## 4. Contribution to Sustainable Development

### What Evaluators Look For
- Environmental sustainability (resource efficiency, emissions)
- Social sustainability (accessibility, inclusion, health)
- Economic sustainability (long-term viability)
- Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals

### How to Demonstrate
- Explicit SDG alignment (identify 1-3 relevant goals)
- Environmental impact assessment or reduction
- Resource efficiency improvements
- Social benefit description (accessibility, health, safety)
- Long-term viability beyond project funding

### Note
This criterion has medium weight but is increasingly important. Projects without sustainability consideration may score lower. Even if the innovation is not directly sustainability-focused, address how it does not harm sustainability goals.

## Scoring Process

1. **Formal check** by Innosuisse Secretariat (completeness)
2. **Expert evaluation** by two independent reviewers
3. **Innovation Council decision** based on expert reports
4. **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks from submission to decision

## Tips for Strong Scores

### Innovation
- Be specific about what is new (not just "innovative")
- Show awareness of competing approaches
- Quantify improvement (X% faster, Y% cheaper)

### Value Creation
- Provide evidence, not just claims
- Include customer quotes or commitments if available
- Show realistic revenue projections with assumptions

### Project Quality
- Use standard work package structure
- Include buffer time in timeline
- Name specific team members with relevant experience
- Address top 5 risks with specific mitigations

### Sustainability
- Even minor sustainability contributions count
- "Do no harm" is minimum expectation
- Connect to specific SDGs where genuine
