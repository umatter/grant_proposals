# Common Mistakes in Innosuisse Innovation Project Applications

## Innovation Section Mistakes

### Weak Innovation Claims

**Problem:** Claiming innovation without evidence or differentiation

**Bad example:**
> "Our solution is innovative and will revolutionize the market."

**Good example:**
> "Unlike existing solutions that require manual calibration (e.g., CompetitorX, CompetitorY), our approach uses self-calibrating sensors that reduce setup time by 85% and eliminate human error. This is enabled by our novel algorithm described in [reference]."

### No State-of-the-Art Comparison

**Problem:** Not showing what exists and why your solution is better

**Solution:** Include explicit comparison table showing:
- Current solutions
- Their limitations
- Your approach
- Quantified improvement

### TRL Confusion

**Problem:** Unclear or unrealistic TRL progression

**Red flags:**
- Claiming TRL 7 at start when no prototype exists
- Planning to jump from TRL 3 to TRL 8 in 18 months

## Value Creation Mistakes

### "The Market is Huge"

**Problem:** Vague market claims without evidence

**Bad example:**
> "The global market for AI is worth billions."

**Good example:**
> "The Swiss industrial inspection market (our SAM) is CHF 450M annually (source: Swiss Federal Statistical Office 2023). We target the automated visual inspection segment (CHF 85M SAM) with an initial focus on pharmaceutical manufacturing (CHF 12M SOM in Year 1)."

### No Customer Validation

**Problem:** No evidence of market need

**Required evidence:**
- Customer interviews (minimum 5-10)
- Letters of intent from potential customers
- Pilot project agreements
- Market research data

### Unclear Business Model

**Problem:** How revenue will be generated is vague

**Include:**
- Pricing model (per unit, subscription, license)
- Sales channel (direct, distributors, OEM)
- Go-to-market timeline
- Revenue projections (3-5 years)

## Project Planning Mistakes

### Vague Deliverables

**Problem:** Deliverables that cannot be measured

**Bad examples:**
- "D1.1: Report on findings"
- "D2.1: Prototype"
- "D3.1: Analysis results"

**Good examples:**
- "D1.1: Technical requirements specification (30+ pages) with validated user requirements from 10+ customer interviews"
- "D2.1: Functional prototype demonstrating core detection algorithm with >90% accuracy on test dataset"
- "D3.1: Benchmark report comparing our solution to 3 commercial alternatives on 5 performance metrics"

### Missing Risk Analysis

**Problem:** No risks identified or only generic risks

**Required:**
- 5-8 specific project risks
- Probability and impact assessment
- Concrete mitigation strategies
- Fallback approaches

**Generic risks to avoid:**
- "The project might be delayed"
- "Technology might not work"
- "Market might change"

**Specific risks:**
- "Data quality from Partner X's production line may be insufficient for training (prob: medium, impact: high). Mitigation: Preliminary data analysis in Month 2; fallback: use synthetic data augmentation."

### Unrealistic Timeline

**Problem:** Too short, too long, or milestones at end

**Red flags:**
- All milestones in last 3 months
- 36-month project with 2 milestones
- No buffer time for delays

**Guidelines:**
- One milestone every 6-9 months
- Include go/no-go decision points
- Build in 10-20% buffer time

## Budget Mistakes

### Wrong Cost Split

**Problem:** Not meeting 40-60% requirement

**Common issues:**
- Innosuisse share >60%
- Implementation partner share <40%
- Missing cash contribution (5-10%)

**Always verify:**
- Calculate percentages BEFORE submission
- Include all partner contributions (in-kind + cash)

### Ineligible Costs Included

**Problem:** Budget includes non-R&D costs

**Not eligible:**
- Marketing activities
- Sales personnel
- Production setup
- General overhead
- Standard office equipment

### Missing Justifications

**Problem:** Budget lines without explanation

**Every line needs:**
- What is being purchased/funded
- Why it's necessary for the project
- Connection to specific work package

### Wrong Hourly Rates

**Problem:** Not using Innosuisse notional rates

**Research partner MUST use:**
- Institution's official notional rates
- Not actual salaries
- Rates from Innosuisse guidelines

---

## Partner-Related Mistakes

### Implementation Partner Too Passive

**Problem:** Implementation partner not meaningfully involved

**Red flags:**
- No named personnel from implementation partner
- Implementation partner contribution is only cash
- No work packages led by implementation partner

**Required:**
- Named team members from both partners
- Both partners lead at least one WP
- Both partners have clear responsibilities

### Unclear Role Division

**Problem:** Who does what is not clear

**Required:**
- Clear work package assignments
- Named responsible persons
- Complementary expertise demonstration

---

## Formal Mistakes

### Late Submission

**Problem:** Missing the 6-week deadline

**Prevention:**
- Note decision meeting dates (8 per year)
- Submit at least 7 weeks early (buffer)
- Complete internal reviews 2 weeks before deadline

### Incomplete Application

**Problem:** Missing required sections or documents

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All Innolink form sections completed
- [ ] Budget spreadsheet attached
- [ ] Team CVs attached
- [ ] Financial annex (if SME <250 FTE)
- [ ] Partner commitment confirmed

### Language Inconsistency

**Problem:** Mixing languages within application

**Rule:** Choose one language and use consistently throughout
- German, French, Italian, or English
- Technical terms can remain in original language

## Recovery Strategies

If you identify mistakes before submission:

| Mistake | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Vague innovation | Add comparison table to state-of-art |
| No market validation | Add customer interview summary |
| Generic risks | Make risks project-specific with numbers |
| Wrong cost split | Recalculate and adjust partner contributions |
| Missing deliverable metrics | Add acceptance criteria to each deliverable |
| Unrealistic timeline | Add buffer, spread milestones |
