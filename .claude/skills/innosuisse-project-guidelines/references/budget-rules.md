# Innosuisse Innovation Project Budget Rules

## Funding Model

### Cost Split Requirements

| Party | Share | Type |

| Innosuisse | 40-60% | Grant to research partner |
| Implementation Partner | 40-60% | In-kind + cash |

## Notional Hourly Rates (Research Partner)

Innosuisse uses standardized hourly rates for personnel cost calculation. Actual rates are set by institutions but typically fall within these ranges:

| Position | Rate Range (CHF/hour) |
|----------|----------------------|
| Full Professor | 160 - 180 |
| Associate Professor | 140 - 160 |
| Senior Researcher / Postdoc | 110 - 130 |
| PhD Student | 70 - 90 |
| Research Assistant | 60 - 80 |
| Technical Staff | 80 - 100 |
| Administrative Support | 50 - 70 |

**Note:** Check current rates with your institution's grants office. Rates are updated periodically by Innosuisse.

### Hours Calculation
- Standard working hours: ~1,880 hours/year (full-time)
- Calculate: FTE x Duration (months) x (1,880/12) x Hourly Rate

**Personnel - Postdoc (24 months, 100%)**
> A postdoctoral researcher (100%, 24 months, CHF 120/hr, total CHF 451,200) is required to lead the experimental development in WP2 and WP3. The position requires expertise in machine learning and computer vision. The postdoc will design the detection algorithms, supervise student contributions, and coordinate with the implementation partner's engineering team.

**Materials - Sensor Components (CHF 45,000)**
> Custom sensor components (CHF 45,000 across project) are needed for prototype development in WP2. This includes: 10x high-resolution cameras (CHF 2,000 each = CHF 20,000), processing units (CHF 15,000), and integration hardware (CHF 10,000). These are project-specific and not available from existing inventory.
