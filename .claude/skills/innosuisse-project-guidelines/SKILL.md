# Innosuisse Innovation Project Guidelines

## Overview

Innosuisse Innovation Projects fund collaborative R&D between Swiss research institutions and implementation partners (companies, startups, public institutions). Projects must demonstrate both scientific excellence and economic value creation for Switzerland.

## Quick Reference

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Innosuisse Funding | 40-60% of total project costs |
| Partner Contribution | 40-60% (min 5-10% cash to research partner) |
| Duration | 6-36 months |
| Maximum Funding | No cap (must be well justified) |
| Typical Range | CHF 500,000 - 2,000,000 |
| Decision Meetings | 8 per year |
| Submission Deadline | 6 weeks before decision meeting |
| Platform | Innolink |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Key Question |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Level of Innovation | High | What is scientifically AND economically novel? |
| Value Creation | High | What benefit for Swiss economy/society? |
| Project Quality | High | Is planning realistic and team competent? |
| Sustainable Development | Medium | Does it contribute to sustainability? |

## Writing Principles

**DO:**
- Emphasize BOTH scientific AND economic novelty
- Quantify market potential and expected benefits
- Show clear path from research to commercialization
- Define measurable deliverables and milestones
- Demonstrate team complementarity (research + industry)
- Address sustainability contribution
- Include risk matrix with mitigations
- Use notional hourly rates for budget

**DON'T:**
- Focus only on scientific aspects (unlike SNSF)
- Underestimate implementation partner contribution
- Ignore market validation evidence
- Present vague deliverables without metrics
- Omit risk analysis
- Include ineligible costs (marketing, sales, general overhead)

## Language Policy

- German, French, Italian, or English accepted
- Match language to implementation partner's preference
- Technical terms can remain in original language

## Key Differences from Innocheck

| Aspect | Innocheck | Innovation Project |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Scope | Preliminary study | Full R&D project |
| Budget | CHF 15,000 fixed | No max (typ. CHF 500K-2M) |
| Duration | 6 months max | 6-36 months |
| Complexity | Simple application | Work packages, Gantt, risk matrix |
| Funding | 100% | 40-60% co-funding |
