# SNSF Agora Rolling Call Guidelines

## Overview

SNSF Agora supports communication projects that promote dialogue between science and society. The program enables researchers to engage directly with the public and communicate research results through creative, interactive methods.

**Key Focus:** Agora is about DIALOGUE, not just dissemination. Projects must foster two-way engagement with the public, not simply broadcast information.

## Quick Reference

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Funding Range | CHF 5,000 - 50,000 |
| Duration | Max. 3 years |
| Submission | Continuous (rolling) |
| Decision Timeline | Within 4 months |
| Project Plan | 5 pages max |
| Language | English only |
| Platform | mySNF |

## Team Requirements (CRITICAL)

Every Agora project MUST include:

| Role | Requirements |
|------|-------------|
| **Researcher** | Min. 20% work-time allocation; SNSF Article 10 compliant |
| **Agora Specialist** | Expert in communication, media, education, or art |

Both contribute conceptually AND operationally to the project.

## Evaluation Criteria (Equally Weighted)

| Criterion | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Content Quality** | Is the research sound? Are key messages clear and accurate? |
| **Communication Method** | Are methods appropriate for the target audience? Will they work? |
| **Team Expertise** | Does the team have the skills to execute this project? |
| **Feasibility** | Is the timeline realistic? Are resources adequate? |
| **Expected Impact** | What quantitative reach and qualitative engagement is expected? |
| **Diversity & Equal Opportunities** | How does the project promote inclusion? |

## Eligible vs. Ineligible Projects

### ELIGIBLE
- Communicating research findings to non-specialists
- Explaining scientific challenges and methods
- Discussing the role of research in society
- Primary audience in Switzerland (secondary international OK)

### INELIGIBLE
- Marketing or institutional communication
- Technology transfer activities
- Science communication research studies
- Projects connected to NRP/NCCR
- Commercial objectives
- One-way dissemination without dialogue

## Budget Categories

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Agora specialists | Fees for communication experts |
| External partners | Collaborating organizations |
| Production/materials | Videos, exhibits, printed materials |
| Communication/publication | Promotional activities, events |

**Note:** Researcher salaries at Swiss universities are generally NOT covered.

## Writing Principles

### DO
- Emphasize dialogue and interaction (bidirectional)
- Define target audience precisely with justification
- Quantify expected reach where possible
- Show how methods suit the specific audience
- Highlight team's relevant experience in communication
- Address diversity and inclusion explicitly

### DON'T
- Treat this as pure dissemination (one-way)
- Use academic jargon without explanation
- Overlook the dialogue requirement
- Forget the Agora specialist requirement
- Exceed the 5-page limit
- Request researcher salaries
