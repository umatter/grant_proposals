## Section 1: Summary (~0.5 pages)

**Purpose:** Provide evaluators with a quick understanding of your project.

**Content:**
- Project goal (2-3 sentences)
- What research is being communicated
- Who is the target audience
- Main communication activities

**Tips:**
- Write this LAST after completing other sections
- Make it standalone - someone reading only this should understand the project
- Avoid jargon

**Example opening:**
> "This project aims to engage Swiss secondary school students with recent advances in renewable energy research through an interactive workshop series and accompanying digital resources..."

## Section 2: Research Context (~1 page)

**Purpose:** Establish the scientific foundation and explain why this research matters.

**Content:**
- Description of the underlying research
- Link to SNSF-funded work OR peer-reviewed publications (REQUIRED)
- Why this research is suitable for public communication
- Key messages to convey (2-3 clear takeaways)

**Tips:**
- Explain the research in accessible language
- Show societal relevance
- Be explicit about the SNSF connection or publications
- Identify what makes this topic timely/interesting to non-specialists

**What to avoid:**

## Section 3: Communication Concept (~1.5 pages)

**Purpose:** Show you understand your audience and have chosen appropriate methods.

**Content:**

### Target Audience
- Who specifically (demographics, interests, prior knowledge)

**Tips:**
- Be specific about audience (not just "general public")
- Justify method choices with audience analysis
- Emphasize interaction, not just broadcasting
- Consider multiple touchpoints

**Example:**
> "Our primary audience is Swiss parents of school-age children (ages 30-50) who make household decisions about energy use. We will reach them through: (1) interactive workshops at community centers in three cantons, featuring hands-on experiments their children can participate in; (2) a follow-up online Q&A series where participants can ask researchers questions directly..."
