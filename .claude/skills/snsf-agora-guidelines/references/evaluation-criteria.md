# SNSF Agora Evaluation Criteria (Detailed)

All six criteria are **equally weighted** in the evaluation. Each must be addressed explicitly in your project plan.

## 1. Content Quality

**What evaluators look for:**
- Strong scientific foundation linked to SNSF-funded research or peer-reviewed publications
- Clear, accurate key messages suitable for non-specialist audiences
- Appropriate simplification without distortion
- Relevant and timely topic

**Strong proposals:**
- Clearly articulate 2-3 key messages the public will take away
- Show how complex research can be made accessible
- Demonstrate relevance to public concerns or interests

**Weak proposals:**
- Vague about what research is being communicated
- Cannot identify clear takeaway messages
- Topic is too niche or irrelevant to general public

## 2. Communication Method Appropriateness

**What evaluators look for:**
- Methods matched to target audience characteristics
- Appropriate channels for reaching that audience
- Dialogue elements (not just broadcasting)
- Creative, engaging approaches

**Strong proposals:**
- Justify WHY chosen methods work for the specific audience
- Include interactive elements (Q&A, workshops, participatory activities)
- Show understanding of where/how target audience consumes information
- Reference successful similar approaches

**Weak proposals:**
- Choose methods without audience-specific justification
- Only include one-way communication (lectures, videos without interaction)
- Use academic formats for non-academic audiences

## 3. Team Expertise

**What evaluators look for:**
- Researcher with deep knowledge of the topic
- Agora specialist with proven communication track record
- Evidence of relevant prior experience
- Complementary skills within the team

**Strong proposals:**
- Highlight specific past science communication projects
- Show communication specialist's portfolio or track record
- Demonstrate previous collaboration between team members
- Include relevant training or qualifications

**Weak proposals:**
- Researcher with no communication experience and no specialist
- Generic CVs without communication-relevant achievements
- Unclear roles or responsibilities

## 4. Project Feasibility

**What evaluators look for:**
- Realistic timeline with clear milestones
- Adequate budget for proposed activities
- Risk awareness and mitigation
- Clear project management approach

**Strong proposals:**
- Detailed timeline with dependencies
- Budget breakdown that matches activities
- Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed
- Show how team will coordinate

**Weak proposals:**
- Vague timeline ("we will produce videos")
- Budget doesn't match scope
- No mention of risks
- Unclear who does what

## 5. Expected Qualitative and Quantitative Impacts

**What evaluators look for:**

### Quantitative
- Estimated reach (number of people)
- Engagement metrics (participants, views, interactions)
- Geographic spread

### Qualitative
- Awareness changes
- Attitude shifts
- Behavioral intentions
- Dialogue quality

**Strong proposals:**
- Specific numbers based on similar projects or platform data
- Clear measurement approach
- Balance quantitative reach with qualitative depth
- Realistic but ambitious targets

**Weak proposals:**
- No numbers ("we hope to reach many people")
- Only focus on reach without engagement
- Unrealistic estimates without justification

---

## 6. Contribution to Diversity and Equal Opportunities

**What evaluators look for:**
- Inclusive target audience definition
- Accessible formats and venues
- Representation in team and content
- Addressing barriers to participation

**Strong proposals:**
- Explicitly address how underrepresented groups will be reached
- Consider accessibility (physical, linguistic, economic)
- Diverse team composition
- Content that reflects diverse perspectives

**Weak proposals:**
- No mention of diversity
- Only target "general public" without inclusion strategy
- Inaccessible venues or formats
- Homogeneous team without acknowledgment

## Scoring Guidance

While SNSF doesn't publish a formal scoring rubric for Agora, proposals are assessed holistically on:
- How well each criterion is addressed
- Internal consistency (do methods match audience? does budget match activities?)
- Clarity and completeness
- Realistic self-assessment

## Tips for Addressing All Six Criteria

1. **Use a checklist** - Explicitly reference each criterion in your proposal
2. **Be specific** - Generic statements score poorly
3. **Show, don't tell** - Use examples, numbers, evidence
4. **Acknowledge limitations** - Realistic proposals are stronger
5. **Emphasize dialogue** - This is Agora's core mission
