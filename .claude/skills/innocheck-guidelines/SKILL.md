| Potential Benefit | High | What value does this create for the implementation partner? |
| Partner Competencies | Medium | Can partners execute and commercialize? |
| Financial Plan | Medium | Are costs realistic for the proposed work? |
| Follow-up Potential | Medium | Will this lead to a larger innovation project? |

## Writing Style Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague claims; use concrete examples and metrics
2. **Highlight Novelty**: Clearly differentiate from existing solutions
3. **Quantify Benefits**: Use numbers for market size, efficiency gains, cost savings
4. **Show Competence**: Reference relevant experience, publications, prior projects
5. **Define Deliverables**: Make outputs measurable and time-bound
6. **Connect to Follow-up**: Explicitly describe the path to a larger project

## Language

Proposals may be submitted in German, French, Italian, or English.
Match the language to the implementation partner's primary business language.
