# SNSF Project Funding Guidelines

## Overview

SNSF Project Funding supports research projects in all disciplines at Swiss higher education institutions. Projects must contribute to scientific advancement and can cover basic or applied research.

## Quick Reference

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Funding Range | CHF 100,000 - 4,000,000 |
| Duration | 1-4 years |
| Per Applicant | Max CHF 250,000/year average |
| Per Project | Max CHF 1,000,000/year |
| Equipment Cap | CHF 100,000 |
| Research Plan | 15 pages / 60,000 chars (single) |
| Research Plan | 17 pages / 68,000 chars (collaborative) |
| CV Achievements | Max 4,350 characters |
| Deadlines | 1 April, 1 October (17:00 Swiss time) |

## Evaluation Criteria

Research shows **Methods & Feasibility** (beta=0.436) and **Scientific Relevance** (beta=0.401) have the strongest influence on funding decisions.

| Criterion | Weight | Key Question |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Scientific Relevance** | High | Why does this research matter? |
| **Originality** | High | What is genuinely new? |
| **Methods & Feasibility** | High | Is this achievable with sound methods? |
| **Track Record** | Medium | Can the applicant deliver? |
| **Topicality** | Medium | Why is this research timely? |

Proposals are scored on a 9-point scale:
- 9 = Outstanding
- 8 = Excellent
- 7 = Very Good (competitive threshold)
- 6 = Good
- 5 = Average (baseline)

## Writing Principles

**DO:**
- Be specific about novelty with explicit differentiation from prior work
- Show feasibility with justified methods
- Connect track record directly to the proposed project
- Quantify where possible (impact, sample sizes, effect sizes)
- Assess risks with concrete mitigation strategies
- Use diverse outputs in CV (data, software, not just papers)

**DON'T:**
- Oversell without evidence
- Ignore limitations or risks
- Exceed page/character limits
- Use journal metrics in CV (Impact Factor, h-index) - DORA compliant
- Include applicant's own salary in budget
- Add overheads or publication costs

## Language Policy

- **English required**: Mathematics, natural/engineering sciences, biology, medicine, psychology, economics, political sciences
- **Swiss languages permitted**: Humanities and other research areas
