# Common Mistakes in SNSF Project Proposals

## Content Mistakes

### Weak Research Questions

**Problem**: Vague or unfocused questions that don't guide the research

**Bad example**:
> "We will study X and see what we find."

**Good example**:
> "We test the hypothesis that X causes Y, predicting an effect of magnitude Z under conditions A and B."

### No Novelty Evidence

**Problem**: Claiming innovation without demonstrating it

**Bad example**:
> "This is an innovative approach."

**Good example**:
> "Unlike Smith (2020) who was limited by method Y, we overcome this limitation through approach Z, enabling for the first time the measurement of..."

### Unjustified Methods

**Problem**: Stating methods without explaining why they're appropriate

**Bad example**:
> "We will use method X."

**Good example**:
> "We chose method X over alternatives Y and Z because it provides superior resolution for our target (sensitivity 10x higher) while maintaining acceptable throughput. This choice is validated by our pilot study (Section 2.2) which achieved..."

### Missing Risk Assessment

**Problem**: No discussion of what could go wrong

**Bad example**:
[Complete absence of risk discussion]

**Good example**:
> "Risk: Participant recruitment may be slower than anticipated.
> Mitigation: We have established partnerships with organizations A, B, and C who have committed to facilitate access. Additionally, we budget for an extended recruitment period in Year 1."

### Disconnected Track Record

**Problem**: CV achievements not linked to the proposed research

**Bad example**:
> "I have published 30 papers in leading journals."

**Good example**:
> "My development of the X methodology (Matter 2020) directly enables the proposed experiments by reducing data requirements by 80%, making the planned large-scale study feasible within the budget."

### Overselling Without Evidence

**Problem**: Grand claims without supporting evidence

**Bad example**:
> "This research will revolutionize the field."

**Good example**:
> "This research will provide the first systematic evidence on X, addressing a gap identified by recent reviews (Smith 2021, Jones 2022) and enabling more precise policy recommendations."

## Structural Mistakes

### Exceeding Limits

| Limit | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| 15 pages / 60,000 characters | Proposal returned without review |
| 17 pages / 68,000 characters (collab) | Proposal returned without review |
| CV 4,350 characters | Proposal returned without review |

**Prevention**:
- Check limits before submission
- Use character count tools (with spaces)
- Leave 5% buffer for final edits

### Wrong Chapter Structure

**Problem**: Not following the prescribed 5-chapter format

**Required Structure**:
1. Summary
2.1. State of Research in the Field
2.2. State of Own Research
2.3. Detailed Research Plan
2.4. Significance and Impact
2.5. Schedule and Milestones

### Wrong Language

**Problem**: Using wrong language for the discipline

| Discipline | Required Language |
|------------|-------------------|
| Economics, Political Science | English |
| Mathematics, Natural Sciences | English |
| Engineering | English |
| Medicine, Psychology | English |
| Humanities | German/French/Italian/English |

### Missing Summary

**Problem**: No standalone summary or summary embedded in introduction

**Solution**: Dedicated Section 1 with ~1 page summary that works independently

### No Timeline/Gantt Chart

**Problem**: Section 2.5 without visual timeline

**Solution**: Include Gantt chart or timeline table with milestones

## Budget Mistakes

### Including Ineligible Costs

| Cost Type | Status | Note |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Applicant salary | NOT eligible | Covered by institution |
| Overheads | NOT eligible | Never funded |
| Standard IT | NOT eligible | Laptops, computers |
| Publication costs | NOT eligible | Separate scheme |

### Exceeding Equipment Cap

**Problem**: Equipment >CHF 100,000 without co-funding

**Solution**:
- Reduce equipment budget to CHF 100,000, OR
- Arrange 50% institutional co-funding for excess

### Subcontracting >20%

**Problem**: Third-party services exceed 20% of budget

**Solution**: Reduce external contracts or justify as essential

### Missing Justifications

**Problem**: Budget lines without explanations

**Solution**: Every cost needs: what, why, how much, when

## CV Mistakes

### Using Prohibited Metrics

**DORA violations** (will reflect poorly):
- "Impact Factor of 45"
- "h-index of 32"
- "Papers in top-tier journals"
- "Highly cited work"

**Acceptable alternatives**:
- Downloads/usage statistics
- Adoption by other labs
- Policy influence
- Awards and recognition

### Publication List Instead of Narrative

**Problem**: Listing publications rather than describing achievements

**Solution**: Write 1-3 achievement narratives in first person, max 4,350 characters total

### Wrong Voice

**Problem**: Writing in third person

**Bad**: "The applicant developed..."
**Good**: "I developed..."

### Exceeding Character Limit

**Problem**: Achievements section >4,350 characters

**Solution**: Count characters with spaces, edit ruthlessly

## Submission Mistakes

### Last-Minute Submission

**Problem**: Technical issues at deadline

**Solution**: Submit 24-48 hours before deadline

### Wrong File Format

**Problem**: Protected PDF, wrong filename

**Correct format**:
- Unprotected PDF
- Filename: `SciencePart_[Name].pdf`

### Missing Supporting Documents

**Common missing items**:
- Letter of commitment from partners
- Teaching reduction confirmation
- Equipment quotes
- Ethics approval (if applicable)

## Recovery Strategies

If you identify these issues before submission:

1. **Weak questions**: Reformulate with testable hypotheses
2. **No novelty**: Add explicit comparison to prior work
3. **Unjustified methods**: Add 1-2 sentences per method choice
4. **No risks**: Add risk table with mitigation
5. **Disconnected CV**: Rewrite linking experience to this project
6. **Over limits**: Cut least essential content first (not methods/risks)
