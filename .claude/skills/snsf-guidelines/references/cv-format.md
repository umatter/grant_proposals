# SNSF CV Format

## Overview

The SNSF uses a standardized CV format. Key components are entered directly in the mySNF system, with the Achievements section being the most critical narrative element.

## CV Structure in mySNF

1. **Personal Information**
   - Name, affiliation, contact
   - ORCID (required and linked)

2. **Academic Age**
   - Net research time in years
   - Accounts for career breaks, part-time work

3. **Education & Employment History**
   - Chronological listing
   - Current and past positions

4. **Achievements** (1-3 narratives)
   - **Maximum 4,350 characters total**
   - Most important section
   - First-person voice required

5. **Selected Works**
   - Up to 10 outputs
   - Should support achievement narratives
   - Diverse output types encouraged

## Achievement Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Style

**Use first person**:
- "I developed..."
- "I led..."
- "My research demonstrated..."

**Be specific about YOUR contribution**:
- What did YOU personally do?
- What was the impact?
- How does this connect to the proposed project?

### DORA Compliance

The SNSF follows the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA).

**Prohibited metrics**:
- Impact Factor
- h-index
- Journal rankings
- Citation counts as primary measure of quality

**Encouraged measures**:
- Adoption by other researchers (downloads, citations in methods)
- Policy impact
- Media coverage
- Invited talks at major venues
- Awards and recognition
- Software/data usage statistics
- Collaborations initiated

### Structure for Each Achievement

1. **What you did** (the contribution)
2. **How you did it** (the approach)
3. **What impact it had** (measurable outcomes)
4. **Why it matters** (broader significance)
5. **Connection to proposed work** (relevance)

### Strong Achievement Example

> "I developed a novel single-cell protocol that reduces input requirements by 90% while maintaining quality metrics comparable to standard approaches. This work, published in Nature Methods (2021), has been adopted by over 50 laboratories worldwide, as evidenced by protocol citations and direct requests for training. The accompanying software tool has been downloaded 3,200 times from GitHub. This methodological innovation established my group as leaders in low-input genomics and directly enables the proposed research on rare cell populations."

**Character count**: ~520 characters

### Weak Achievement Example

> "I have published extensively in high-impact journals including Nature and Science, with an h-index of 35 and over 5,000 citations. My work is well-cited and recognized internationally."

**Problems**:
- Uses prohibited metrics (h-index, impact factor implications)
- No specific contribution described
- No measurable impact beyond metrics
- No connection to proposed work

## Selected Works Guidelines

### Diversity of Outputs

Include a mix of:
- Publications (research articles, reviews)
- Datasets (with DOI)
- Software/code (GitHub with DOI via Zenodo)
- Preprints (where appropriate)
- Patents (if applicable)
- Policy reports
- Methodological resources

### Selection Criteria

Choose works that:
1. Support your achievement narratives
2. Demonstrate expertise relevant to the proposal
3. Show independence and leadership
4. Represent your best contributions (not just most recent)

### Format

For each output:
- Full citation with all authors
- DOI or persistent identifier
- Brief note on your specific contribution (if co-authored)

## Character Counting Tips

- Count characters WITH spaces
- Use a word processor's character count feature
- Budget ~1,400 characters per achievement (for 3 achievements)
- Leave small buffer for editing
- Front-load the most important information

## Common Mistakes

1. **Exceeding 4,350 characters**: Proposal may be returned
2. **Using journal metrics**: Violates DORA; reflects poorly
3. **Generic descriptions**: "I published papers on X" - too vague
4. **No project connection**: Achievements should lead to this proposal
5. **Third person writing**: Must use first person
6. **Publication lists**: Achievements, not bibliography
7. **Team achievements without personal contribution**: Clarify YOUR role
