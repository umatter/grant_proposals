## Budget Justification Requirements

For each budget line, provide:

1. **What**: Specific item or service
2. **Why**: Connection to research objectives
3. **How much**: Detailed cost breakdown
4. **When**: Timing in project timeline

### Example Justification

**Personnel - Postdoc (24 months, 100%)**
> A postdoctoral researcher (100%, 24 months, CHF 110,000/year including social costs) is required to conduct the primary experimental work in WP1 and WP2. The position requires expertise in machine learning and experimental economics, specifically experience with online experiments. The postdoc will be responsible for implementing the bot-based experimental framework and analyzing the collected data.

**Equipment - Residential Proxy Services**
> Residential proxy services (CHF 18,000/year, 2 years = CHF 36,000) are essential to assign realistic IP addresses to our synthetic users. This is critical for the experimental design as without residential IPs, platforms can detect automated access. Quote from Multilogin Software Ltd attached.

## Budget Presentation

Use a clear table format:

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Personnel | | | | |
| Equipment | | | | |
| Consumables | | | | |
| Travel | | | | |
| Third-party | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | |

## Common Budget Mistakes

1. **Including applicant salary**: Not eligible
2. **Exceeding equipment cap**: Need co-funding above CHF 100k
3. **Missing justifications**: Every line needs explanation
4. **Subcontracting >20%**: Exceeds limit
5. **Overheads included**: Not funded
6. **Misaligned with work packages**: Costs should match activities
7. **Missing social contributions**: Add ~15% to salaries
8. **Publication costs**: Not eligible (separate SNSF scheme)
