## Chapter-by-Chapter Guide

### 1. Summary (~1 page)

**Purpose**: Standalone overview accessible to non-specialists

**Content**:
- Project title
- Core research question(s)
- Methodology overview
- Expected outcomes and impact

**Tips**:
- Write LAST after completing other sections
- Should stand alone without reading the full proposal
- Avoid jargon; accessible to panel members outside your field
- Include 1-2 sentences on significance

### 2.1 State of Research in the Field (2-3 pages)

**Purpose**: Position your research within the broader field

**Structure**:
1. **Context**: Introduce the general field and its importance
2. **Current Knowledge**: Summarize key findings and approaches
3. **Gaps**: Identify unanswered questions and limitations
4. **Your Positioning**: How your project addresses these gaps

**Tips**:
- Balance seminal works with recent publications (last 5 years)
- Be fair to prior work while highlighting limitations
- Create a logical flow: Context -> Knowledge -> Gap -> Your Solution
- Use subheadings for clarity with multi-topic proposals

### 2.2 State of Own Research (1-2 pages)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate your capability to execute this project

**Content**:
- Relevant prior work and publications
- Preliminary results (if any)
- Pilot data that motivates or validates the approach
- How your experience specifically enables THIS project

**Tips**:
- Focus on relevance, not comprehensiveness
- If new to the field, emphasize transferable skills
- Reference SNF-funded preliminary work if applicable
- Show progression from prior work to proposed research

### 2.3 Detailed Research Plan (6-8 pages)

**Purpose**: Core of the proposal; convince reviewers of feasibility

**Required Components**:

#### Objectives
- Number each objective clearly (O1, O2, O3...)
- Make objectives specific and measurable
- Limit to 3-5 major objectives

#### Hypotheses
- State testable hypotheses where applicable
- Connect hypotheses to objectives

#### Methods
- Justify each methodological choice
- Compare to alternatives and explain why your approach is superior
- Include sample sizes, power calculations where relevant
- Describe data sources and access

#### Work Packages
- Break project into logical phases (WP1, WP2, WP3...)
- Show dependencies between packages
- Assign personnel to each package
- Define deliverables per package

#### Risks and Mitigation
- Identify 3-5 major risks (technical, timeline, data access)
- Rate probability and impact
- Provide concrete mitigation strategies
- Include fallback approaches

#### Expected Results
- What outputs will each objective produce?
- How will success be measured?

**Example Structure**:
```
2.3.1 Objectives
2.3.2 Hypotheses
2.3.3 Methods
  2.3.3.1 Data Collection
  2.3.3.2 Experimental Design
  2.3.3.3 Analysis Approach
2.3.4 Work Packages
2.3.5 Risks and Mitigation
2.3.6 Expected Results
```

### 2.4 Significance and Impact (1-2 pages)

**Purpose**: Articulate why this research matters beyond the academic contribution

**Content**:
- Scientific contribution to the field
- Broader societal impact
- Policy implications (if applicable)
- Methodological contributions
- Training and educational value
- Potential for follow-up research

**Tips**:
- Be specific about impact pathways
- Avoid generic statements about "advancing knowledge"
- Connect to real-world applications where genuine

### 2.5 Schedule and Milestones (~1 page)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate realistic planning and project management

**Required Elements**:
- Timeline (Gantt chart or table format)
- Key milestones with dates
- Deliverables tied to milestones
- Go/no-go decision points

**Visual Formats**:
- Gantt chart (recommended)
- Timeline table with columns: Task | Start | End | Deliverable | Milestone
- Use color coding for different work packages

**Tips**:
- Include buffer time for unexpected delays
- Show personnel allocation across timeline
- Align schedule with budget periods
- Mark submission deadlines (papers, datasets)

## Bibliography

- Not included in page count
- Use consistent citation style (e.g., APA, Chicago)
- Include DOIs where available
- Balance classic references with recent work
