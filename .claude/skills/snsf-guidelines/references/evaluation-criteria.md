## Scoring Scale

| Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 9 | Outstanding | Exceptional in all aspects |
| 8 | Excellent | Strong across all criteria |
| 7 | Very Good | Competitive; likely fundable |
| 6 | Good | Solid but has weaknesses |
| 5 | Average | Baseline; needs improvement |
| 4 | Below Average | Significant weaknesses |
| 1-3 | Poor | Major deficiencies |

**Target**: Aim for 7+ on all criteria to be competitive.

## Scientific Quality Criteria

### 1. Scientific Relevance (High Weight)

**What reviewers assess:**
- Importance for the discipline
- Contribution to scientific knowledge
- Broader implications beyond the field

**How to demonstrate:**
- Identify a clear gap that matters to the field
- Connect to major open questions in the discipline
- Show potential for paradigm shifts or new directions
- Reference why the community cares about this problem

**Strong example:**
> "Understanding the causal mechanisms of X addresses a fundamental question in Y that has implications for policy, theory, and practice across Z domains."

**Weak example:**
> "This research is important because no one has studied X before."

### 2. Originality (High Weight)

**What reviewers assess:**
- Novel questions, methods, or synthesis
- Advancement beyond state-of-the-art
- Creative approaches to known problems

**How to demonstrate:**
- Explicitly differentiate from prior work
- Articulate what is genuinely new
- Show how this goes beyond incremental extension

**Strong example:**
> "Unlike Smith (2020) who was limited by Y, we overcome this limitation via Z, enabling for the first time the measurement of..."

**Weak example:**
> "This is an innovative project." (without evidence)

### 3. Methods & Feasibility (Highest Weight: beta=0.436)

**What reviewers assess:**
- Appropriateness of methods for research questions
- Justification for methodological choices
- Soundness of experimental/analytical design
- Realistic timeline and resource allocation
- Risk awareness with mitigation strategies

**How to demonstrate:**
- Justify WHY you chose method X over alternatives
- Show you have access to necessary resources
- Include preliminary data or pilot results where possible
- Address what happens if primary approach fails
- Break down work into logical packages with dependencies

**Strong example:**
> "We chose method X over Y because it provides superior resolution for our target analyte (sensitivity 10x higher, Smith et al. 2021). Should X prove insufficient, we will fall back to Z, which we have successfully employed in prior work (Matter 2020)."

**Weak example:**
> "We will use method X." (without justification)

### 4. Topicality (Medium Weight)

**What reviewers assess:**
- Timeliness of the research
- Relevance to current scientific debates
- Responsiveness to recent developments

**How to demonstrate:**
- Reference recent publications (last 2-3 years)
- Connect to emerging trends or debates
- Explain why NOW is the right time

## Applicant Qualifications

### 5. Track Record (Medium Weight)

**What reviewers assess:**
- Quality over quantity of outputs
- Independence indicators
- Relevance to proposed work
- Ability to execute projects of this scope

**How to demonstrate:**
- Show specific achievements with measurable impact
- Connect prior experience to this project
- Demonstrate leadership and independence
- Use first person and DORA-compliant language

**Strong example:**
> "I developed a single-cell protocol reducing input requirements by 90% while maintaining quality. Published in Nature Methods, it has been adopted by 50+ labs and the software has 3,000+ downloads. This establishes my expertise directly relevant to the proposed work on..."

**Weak example:**
> "I have published 45 papers with h-index 23."
